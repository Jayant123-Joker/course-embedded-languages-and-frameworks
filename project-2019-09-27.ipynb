    "  * The language should support some family of methods or operators that can appear in expressions (also 10-20).\n",
    "2. Implement a way to automatically check that a module or function that represents a program within the embedded language conforms to the syntax of the language.\n",
    "3. Implement two analyses and transformations on programs within the embedded language."
